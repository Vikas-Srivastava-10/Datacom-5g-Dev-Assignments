Assignment 7: Create a script that takes a text file and replaces all occurrences of "old_text" with "new_text". Use sed to perform this operation and output the result to a new file.

Solution :

input_file="$1"
output_file="$2"

if [ ! -f "$input_file" ]; then
    echo "Input file not found"
    exit 1
fi

sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' "$input_file" > "$output_file"

echo "Replacement completed. Output saved in $output_file"
