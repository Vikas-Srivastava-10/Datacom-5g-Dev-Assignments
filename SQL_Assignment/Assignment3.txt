Assignment 3: Explain the ACID properties of a transaction in your own words. Write SQL statements to simulate a transaction that includes locking and demonstrate different isolation levels to show concurrency control.

Solution : ACID Properties -

1. Atomicity - A transaction must either complete fully or not happen at all. If any step fails, everything is rolled back.
   example - When we go to Atm for cash withdrawal while transaction if electricity is gone then the whole process will be rolled back.

2. Consistency - A transaction takes the database from one valid state to another valid state. Constraints (PK, FK, CHECK) are never broken.
   example - Account balance should never become negative.

3. Isolation - Multiple transactions running at the same time should not see each other’s incomplete work.
   example - 

4. Durability - Once a transaction is committed, data is saved forever, even if the system crashes.
   example - After COMMIT, power failure should not lose data.
