Assignment 2: Design a database schema for a library system, including tables, fields, and constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK. Include primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

Solution : The library wants to manage:

Books

Authors

Members

Categories

A book can have one author
A member can borrow many books
A book can be borrowed many times (at different times)

1) Author Table -

CREATE TABLE author (
    auth_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    auth_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(60) UNIQUE
);

2) Category Table -

CREATE TABLE category (
    category_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

3) Book Table -

CREATE TABLE book (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    author_id INT NOT NULL,
    category_id INT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(6,2) CHECK (price > 0),
    available_copies INT CHECK (available_copies >= 0),

    FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES author(author_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES category(category_id)
);

4) Member Table -

CREATE TABLE member (
    member_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    member_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    membership_type VARCHAR(20)
        CHECK (membership_type IN ('Student', 'Regular', 'Premium'))
);
